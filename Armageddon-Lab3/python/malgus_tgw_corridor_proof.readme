This Python script collects a network topology snapshot of AWS Transit Gateway (TGW) resources across regions to provide verifiable evidence of cross-region connectivity. Using boto3, it queries the EC2 API in both Tokyo (ap-northeast-1) and São Paulo (sa-east-1) to enumerate all Transit Gateways and their associated attachments, capturing the authoritative state of the routing backbone at a specific point in time.

The primary purpose of the script is to prove that network corridors actually exist and are attached as designed, rather than relying on assumptions or architectural diagrams. By exporting both TGW definitions and attachment metadata, the script documents how VPCs, peering connections, or VPNs are connected to the transit layer in each region, which is critical during audits, change reviews, and incident investigations.

In multi-region architectures, network misconfigurations are a common root cause of outages and security gaps. This script enables operators to rapidly confirm that Transit Gateways are present where expected, that attachments are active, and that cross-region paths are intact. Because the data is gathered directly from AWS APIs and rendered as structured JSON, it can be archived, diffed over time, or attached to incident reports as objective evidence.

Within the context of Lab 3, this tool supports the Japan–São Paulo design by validating that the global network fabric connecting the two regions is explicitly defined and operational. It reinforces the principle that routing must be provable and observable, ensuring that cross-region traffic flows are intentional, auditable, and aligned with the overall security and compliance goals of the architecture.
